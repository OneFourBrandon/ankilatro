# Welcome to the home of Ankilatro (Balanki was already taken!)

## About:  
Are you in a class where the last thing you want to do is study? Can't bear getting past the authenticator app without doom scrolling reels for 3 hours? Welcome to ***Ankilatro***! A mod that tries to make you study by force feeding you Anki Cards between Balatro blinds! No longer will you have to force yourself to study. You must complete Anki Cards to be rewarded with that Sweet Sweet Dopamine of big number go up!
