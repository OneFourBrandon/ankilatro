# Welcome to Ankilatro (Balanki was already taken!)

## About:  
Are you in a class where the last thing you want to do is study? Can't bear getting past the authenticator app without doom scrolling reels for 3 hours? Welcome to ***Ankilatro***! A mod that tries to make you study by force feeding you Anki Cards between Balatro blinds! No longer will you have to force yourself to study. You must complete Anki Cards to be rewarded with that Sweet Sweet Dopamine of big number go up!

## Installation
### Pre-requisites
    - [AnkiConnect][https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159] >= Version 6
    - Balatro (>=1.0.1o)
    - Steamodded (>=1.0.0~BETA-1016c)
    - Lovely (>=0.8)

### Once the prerequites are installed, place the mod in your %appdata%/balatro/mods folder. (Or if you're on linux, you probably already know where to put it)

### Usage
Ensure that Anki is running and that AnkiConnect is installed; otherwise, the mod will be unable to retrieve cards.
When you press the Cash Out button, *three* Anki cards will be presented for you to review and answer.
Completed cards will not immediately reflect as updated in Anki. To refresh their status, return to Anki and click the Decks button.
